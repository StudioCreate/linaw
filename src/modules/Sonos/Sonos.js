/**
 * connect to Sonos service
 * this module is a simple prototype to connect to a sonos system
 * the system and players are automatically discovered.
 * each player volume can be changed through a socket event
 * the options are currently unknown since the source module is not documented
 * the module is currently being rewritten and a dev version is loaded here
 *
 * This module is using an experimental version of sonos-discovery
 * current progress of the new version can be tracked here:
 *   https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-discovery/tree/refactor-with-promises
 * for now I forked and made a release for stable versioning
 * see '/packages.json' to retreive the currently used version
